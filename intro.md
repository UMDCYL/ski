# Robot Backcountry Skiing

You're a robot skiing in the woods!

# Rules

# Motion

The player robot can move in 8 directions: `north`, `east`, `south`, `west`, `northeast`, `southeast`, `southwest` and `northwest`. The player can also `teleport` (teleporting can result in landing on a robot).

# Sensors

The player robot has many sensor variables it can use to help inform its moves.
